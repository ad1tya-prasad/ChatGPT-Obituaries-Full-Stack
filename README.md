# Fake Obituaries Full Stack Project

This full stack application uses React and AWS that generates obituaries for people. It uses [ChatGPT's Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/making-requests) to generate an obituary, along with [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) to turn the obituary into speech, and the [Cloudinary Upload API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference) to store the speech and a picture of the deceased (may they rest in peace).

## Front End

The front end of this application is created using React and is hosted on Netlify, you can find the website [here](https://obituary-maker.netlify.app) (obituary-maker.netlify.app).

## Back End

The back end of this application consists of of 2 AWS lambda functions and an AWS DynamoDB table. All of the back end infrastructure is created and maintained using Terraform.

The two lambda functions are:

  - `get-obituaries`: to retrieve all the obituaries. Function URL only allows `GET` requests
  - `create-obituary`: to create a new obituary, this function is a bit more complicated:
      - It first reads all the data from the user (including the image)
      - then, it stores the image into Cloudinary, followed by generating an obituary for the given person using ChatGPT.
      - Further, it takes the generated obituary and uses Amazon Polly to generate an mp3 file which then gets stored into Cloudinary as well.
      - Lastly, it stores all the given data of the user along with the urls for the image and speech files being stored in Cloudinary.

Note: The API keys needed for each API call are stored securly using AWS Systems Manager in Parameter Store. They are read using the AWS Systems Manager API.

The DynamoDB Table:

- This table holds the following characteristics:
    - "name": name of the person
    - "born": birthday
    - "died": date of death
    - "img": image url saved in Cloudinary
    - "obituary": obituary generated by ChatGPT
    - "voice": url of speech saved in Cloudinary
